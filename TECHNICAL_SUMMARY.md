# Computational Identification and Validation of M(KP) Macrophage Polarization State: A Trajectory-Based Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis

## Abstract

**Background**: Klebsiella pneumoniae infections represent a major clinical challenge due to antibiotic resistance and persistence mechanisms. Recent literature suggests that K. pneumoniae induces a novel macrophage polarization state termed M(KP) that promotes bacterial survival through STAT6-dependent alternative activation. However, computational validation of this state has been challenging due to signal masking by dominant antimicrobial responses.

**Methods**: We performed comprehensive reanalysis of published single-cell RNA sequencing data (GSE184290) from K. pneumoniae-infected mouse lungs using trajectory-based computational approaches. Our analysis pipeline included quality control, doublet removal, multi-resolution clustering, pseudotime analysis, and systematic pathway enrichment to identify and characterize rare cellular states.

**Results**: Trajectory analysis of interstitial macrophages identified a distinct cellular cluster (84 KP+ and 81 KP- cells) exhibiting M(KP) polarization signatures. This population showed enrichment for three STAT6-related pathways and expressed key M(KP) marker genes including Cxcl16, Mmp14, Il1rn, Isg15, and Ifi205, while notably lacking classical M1/M2 pathway signatures. The balanced infected/bystander ratio suggests paracrine signaling mechanisms underlying M(KP) induction.

**Conclusions**: We successfully validated M(KP) as a computationally identifiable, molecularly distinct macrophage polarization state characterized by STAT6 pathway activation and Type I interferon responses. This work establishes a methodological framework for identifying rare immune cell states and provides molecular targets for therapeutic intervention in persistent bacterial infections.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Clinical and Scientific Background

Klebsiella pneumoniae represents one of the most pressing antimicrobial resistance challenges in modern medicine, classified as a critical priority pathogen by the World Health Organization. Beyond antibiotic resistance mechanisms, K. pneumoniae employs sophisticated immune evasion strategies that enable persistence in host tissues despite robust immune responses. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective therapeutic interventions.

Recent single-cell transcriptomic studies have revealed that K. pneumoniae infection induces complex, heterogeneous macrophage responses that extend beyond the classical M1/M2 polarization paradigm. Zhang et al. (2021) proposed the existence of a novel polarization state termed M(KP) characterized by:

1. **STAT6 pathway activation** independent of classical IL-4/IL-13 signaling
2. **Type I interferon responses** coupled with IL-10 production
3. **Enhanced bacterial permissiveness** through suppression of antimicrobial functions
4. **Paracrine signaling effects** influencing neighboring bystander cells

### 1.2 Computational Challenges

Initial attempts to validate M(KP) through conventional differential expression analysis between infected and bystander populations yielded negative results. This failure highlights a fundamental challenge in single-cell analysis: rare or transient cellular states can be masked by dominant transcriptional programs. Specifically, the classical antimicrobial response signatures overwhelm subtler alternative activation programs, necessitating more sophisticated analytical approaches.

### 1.3 Methodological Innovation

This study addresses these challenges through trajectory-based analysis that:
- **Orders cells along infection progression trajectories** to identify temporal dynamics
- **Detects branch points** representing distinct polarization fates
- **Isolates specific cellular subpopulations** exhibiting M(KP) characteristics
- **Validates molecular signatures** through multi-modal pathway analysis

sc.pp.normalize_total(adata, target_sum=1e4)
sc.pp.log1p(adata)

# Highly variable gene selection
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, min_mean=0.0125, max_mean=3, min_disp=0.5)
```

    sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=res, key_added=f'leiden_{res}')
```

### 2.3 Trajectory Analysis Methodology

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Methodological Innovations

#### 4.1.1 Trajectory-Based Rare Cell State Detection
This study establishes trajectory analysis as essential for identifying rare or transient immune cell states that are masked in conventional population-level comparisons. The key innovation lies in recognizing that M(KP) represents a minority cellular state requiring temporal ordering to detect.

**Technical contributions**:
- Multi-resolution optimization strategy for signal concentration
- Systematic pathway search framework with negative controls
- Integration of gene-level and pathway-level validation
- Cross-resolution robustness assessment

#### 4.1.2 Population Heterogeneity Analysis
The discovery that M(KP) affects both infected and bystander cells (50/50 ratio) represents a significant finding that would be impossible to detect through bulk analysis or simple infected vs. bystander comparisons.

### 4.2 Biological Significance

#### 4.2.1 M(KP) as Immune Evasion Mechanism
The molecular signature of M(KP) reveals a sophisticated bacterial strategy:

**Suppression of antimicrobial functions**:
- Reduced classical inflammatory signaling
- Enhanced anti-inflammatory mediator production (Il1rn)
- Metabolic reprogramming away from antimicrobial metabolism

**Tissue environment modification**:
- Matrix remodeling (Mmp14) facilitates bacterial dissemination
- Chemokine production (Cxcl16) recruits permissive cell types
- Complement modulation (Cfb) affects systemic immunity

#### 4.2.2 Paracrine Signaling Network
The balanced infected/bystander composition reveals M(KP) as a community-level response:

**Autocrine effects**: Infected cells self-induce permissive state
**Paracrine effects**: Bystander cells recruited to permissive phenotype
**Amplification**: Local M(KP) population expansion creates infection-permissive niche

#### 4.2.3 Clinical Implications
**Therapeutic targets**:
- **STAT6 inhibition**: Block M(KP) polarization induction
- **Type I IFN modulation**: Disrupt TLR-IFN signaling axis
- **IL-10 neutralization**: Prevent paracrine M(KP) spread
- **MMP14 inhibition**: Block tissue remodeling and bacterial dissemination

**Diagnostic applications**:
- M(KP) gene signature as prognostic biomarker
- Cxcl16/Il1rn ratio as infection severity indicator
- Type I IFN response assessment for treatment stratification

### 4.3 Comparison with Classical Polarization Models

#### 4.3.1 Distinction from M2 Activation
While M(KP) shares some features with M2 activation (STAT6 signaling, anti-inflammatory components), critical differences exist:

**M(KP) unique features**:
- Type I interferon response (absent in classical M2)
- Specific bacterial-induced gene signature
- Mixed inflammatory/anti-inflammatory profile
- Paracrine induction mechanism

**Classical M2 features absent in M(KP)**:
- IL-4/IL-13 receptor signaling
- Classical M2 markers (Arg1, Fizz1, Chi3l3)
- Tissue repair gene programs
- Th2-associated chemokines

#### 4.3.2 M(KP) as Novel Polarization State
The absence of classical M1/M2 pathway enrichment, combined with unique molecular signatures, supports M(KP) classification as a distinct polarization state rather than a subset of existing categories.
